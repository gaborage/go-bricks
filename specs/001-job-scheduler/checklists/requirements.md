# Specification Quality Checklist: Job Scheduler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review:**
- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details (e.g., mentions "Job interface" and "JobRegistrar" as abstractions, not specific code structures)
- ✅ Focuses on user value: automated background tasks, operational visibility, testing flexibility, lifecycle management
- ✅ Written for non-technical stakeholders: user stories use plain language, business-focused outcomes
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness Review:**
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found in specification
- ✅ Requirements are testable: Each FR specifies concrete behavior that can be verified (e.g., FR-003: "JobRegistrar MUST support fixed-rate scheduling")
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable: All SC items include specific metrics (e.g., SC-002: "within 1 second", SC-004: "within 100 milliseconds", SC-007: "up to 1000 jobs")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic: Focus on observable outcomes (execution timing, API response times, shutdown duration) rather than internal implementation
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios defined: Each user story includes Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy paths and edge cases
- ✅ Edge cases identified: 8 edge cases documented covering execution overlap, clock changes, panics, concurrency, invalid inputs
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded: Feature focused on scheduling with 5 specific patterns, system APIs, lifecycle management, and observability
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions identified: 10 assumptions documented covering defaults, behaviors, and integration patterns

**Feature Readiness Review:**
- ✅ Functional requirements map to user stories: FR-001 to FR-007 support P1 (scheduling), FR-009 to FR-010 support P2 (monitoring), FR-011 to FR-012 support P3 (manual trigger), FR-013 to FR-016 support P2 (lifecycle), FR-017 to FR-020 support P2 (observability)
- ✅ User scenarios comprehensive: 5 prioritized stories cover core scheduling (P1), monitoring (P2), manual execution (P3), lifecycle (P2), and observability (P2)
- ✅ Success criteria aligned with user needs: Developer ease-of-use (SC-001: <10 lines of code), operational requirements (SC-004: API response time, SC-005: shutdown time), reliability (SC-008: 100% panic recovery)
- ✅ No implementation leakage: Specification describes capabilities and behaviors without prescribing code structure (though it does reference specific underlying library gocron/v2 from input description)

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`. All quality criteria have been met:
- Clear separation between WHAT (feature capabilities) and HOW (implementation)
- Measurable, testable requirements throughout
- Comprehensive user scenarios with independent test criteria
- All assumptions and edge cases documented
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focusing on observable outcomes
