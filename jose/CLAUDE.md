# jose/ — GoBricks package rules

Loaded when work touches `jose/`. Repo-wide rules stay in the root [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## JOSE Middleware

Nested JWE-of-JWS protection on HTTP request and response bodies. Designed for **Visa Token Services**-style integrations and any partner API requiring sign-then-encrypt outbound and decrypt-then-verify inbound on every payload.

**Strict allowlist:** `RS256`/`PS256` for signing; `RSA-OAEP-256` + `A256GCM` for encryption. `alg=none`, `HS*`, `RSA1_5` rejected at parse time. Bidirectional symmetry enforced (request and response must both have tags or neither). Pre-trust failures emit minimal `{code,message}` plaintext envelopes; post-trust handler errors emit the standard envelope, encrypted.

Register `keystore.NewModule()` BEFORE any module declaring jose-tagged routes. For tag syntax, key resolution, the full failure-mode → `IAPIError` mapping table, replay-protection notes, and test utilities, see [wiki/jose.md](../wiki/jose.md).
